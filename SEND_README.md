## 💬 Common Questions

### Q: Is this production ready?
**A**: Yes! The implementation is complete and tested. Just configure your environment variables and test thoroughly.

### Q: How does gasless work on EVM?
**A**: CDP Smart Accounts sponsor gas fees for ERC-20 transfers. Users only pay for the tokens they're sending, not the gas.

### Q: Why does Solana require fees?
**A**: Solana's architecture requires all transactions to pay fees. The fees are very small (~$0.0001) but necessary for network security.

### Q: Can users send to themselves?
**A**: Yes, self-transfers are allowed (though not common).

### Q: What if a transaction fails?
**A**: The error state shows a clear message and "Try Again" button. Common failures are handled gracefully.

### Q: Can I customize the UI?
**A**: Yes! All components use CSS custom properties from your theme system. Easy to customize colors, spacing, etc.

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security
- Never commit `.env.local` file
- CDP credentials are server-side only
- Users' private keys stay in CDP (secure)
- Address validation prevents typos

### Gasless Transactions
- Only for EVM (Base) ERC-20 tokens
- Native ETH transfers still require gas
- CDP has limits (check your plan)
- Amazing UX benefit!

### Solana Fees
- Always required for any transaction
- Keep minimum 0.01 SOL in wallet
- Fees automatically deducted
- Very small cost
