## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Ensure Environment Variables Are Set

Create or verify your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# CDP Authentication (Server-side only - DO NOT commit!)
CDP_API_KEY_ID=your_cdp_api_key_id
CDP_API_KEY_SECRET=your_cdp_api_key_secret

# CDP Project Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_API_KEY=your_onchainkit_api_key

# Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MAINNET=false  # Start with testnet (false)
```

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Send Feature

#### For Base (EVM) Testing:

1. **Get Test ETH**
   - Visit Base Sepolia faucet: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-sepolia-faucet
   - Enter your wallet address (click wallet in app to copy)
   - Receive testnet ETH

2. **Test Native ETH Transfer**
   - Open wallet dropdown
   - Click "Send" tab
   - Select "ETH" from token dropdown
   - Enter test recipient address
   - Enter amount (or click MAX)
   - Click "Send" and confirm
   - View transaction on BaseScan

3. **Get Test USDC** (for gasless testing)
   - Use CDP faucet or testnet DEX
   - Once received, it will appear in your Assets tab

4. **Test Gasless USDC Transfer** 🎉
   - Select "USDC" from token dropdown
   - Enter recipient address
   - Enter amount
   - Send without any ETH for gas!
   - Witness the gasless magic

#### For Solana Testing:

1. **Get Test SOL**
   - Visit Solana faucet: https://faucet.solana.com
   - Or use: `solana airdrop 1 YOUR_ADDRESS --url devnet`
   - Receive devnet SOL

2. **Test Native SOL Transfer**
   - Switch to Solana in wallet (click Solana logo)
   - Click "Send" tab
   - Select "SOL" from dropdown
   - Enter recipient address
   - Enter amount (ensure you keep some SOL for fees!)
   - Send and view on Solana Explorer

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Open wallet dropdown
- [ ] Switch between Ethereum and Solana chains
- [ ] Click on Send tab
- [ ] See token dropdown populated with balances
- [ ] Enter valid recipient address (no error)
- [ ] Enter invalid address (see validation error)
- [ ] Click MAX button (fills full balance)
- [ ] Enter custom amount
- [ ] Click "Send" to see confirmation screen

### Confirmation Flow
- [ ] See transaction details (token, amount, recipient)
- [ ] See "Gasless" badge for EVM
- [ ] See "Fee required" badge for Solana
- [ ] Cancel confirmation (returns to form)
- [ ] Confirm transaction (see loading state)

### Transaction Success
- [ ] See success checkmark
- [ ] See transaction hash/signature
- [ ] Click "View on Explorer" (opens in new tab)
- [ ] Verify transaction on explorer
- [ ] Click "Send Another" (resets form)
- [ ] Check Assets tab (balance updated)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Try sending more than balance (error)
- [ ] Try invalid address format (validation error)
- [ ] Try sending without sufficient SOL for fees on Solana (error)
- [ ] See clear error message
- [ ] Click "Try Again" (returns to form)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Send with exactly 0 balance (disabled)
- [ ] Send to own address (allowed)
- [ ] Switch chains mid-flow (form resets)
- [ ] Close dropdown mid-transaction (safe)

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### If Balances Don't Load
1. Check CDP API credentials in `.env.local`
2. Check console for API errors
3. Verify network setting matches your accounts
4. Try switching chains back and forth

### If Transaction Fails
1. **EVM**: Check if Smart Account is created (should be automatic)
2. **Solana**: Ensure sufficient SOL for fees
3. **Both**: Check recipient address format
4. **Both**: Check console logs for detailed error
5. Verify network connectivity

### Console Logs to Check
```javascript
// Look for these logs in browser console:
"Sending Solana transaction..." // When sending on Solana
"Transaction sent!" // On successful Solana send
"Error sending EVM transaction:" // On EVM error
"Error sending Solana transaction:" // On Solana error
```

## 🎯 What to Test First

### Recommended Testing Order:

1. **EVM Native Transfer (Base Sepolia)**
   - Easiest to get testnet funds
   - Tests basic Smart Account functionality
   - Get comfortable with the flow

2. **EVM Gasless Token Transfer**
   - Shows off the killer feature!
   - Tests ERC-20 functionality
   - No gas needed = great UX

3. **Solana Native Transfer (Devnet)**
   - Tests Solana integration
   - Different address format
   - Fee handling

4. **Solana SPL Token Transfer**
   - Advanced Solana feature
   - Tests token account handling
   - Full Solana functionality

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No tokens available to send"
**Solution**: 
- Check if balances loaded (look in Assets tab)
- Verify CDP API credentials
- Request faucet funds

### Issue: "Invalid address" error
**Solution**:
- EVM: Must start with "0x" and be 42 chars total
- Solana: Must be valid base58 (copy from explorer)

### Issue: Transaction fails on Solana
**Solution**:
- Ensure you have SOL for transaction fees
- Keep at least 0.01 SOL for fees
- Check recipient token account exists (for SPL)

### Issue: SendTab component not showing
**Solution**:
- Verify import in WalletDropdown.tsx
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache and reload
