# x402 Protocol Pioneers NFT Contract - Testing Completed ✅

## Overview
Comprehensive Foundry test suite has been created for the x402 Protocol Pioneers NFT contract, addressing all critical requirements from the handoff document.

## 🎯 Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT TESTING

### Critical Requirements Completed ✅

#### PRIORITY 1: Gas Testing ✅
- **Test Location**: `test/X402Gas.t.sol` and `test/X402Airdrop.t.sol`
- **Critical Function**: `testGas_AirdropGasConsumption()`
- **Purpose**: Measures actual gas consumption for automatic airdrop (47 NFTs)
- **Safety Check**: Asserts gas usage < 20M (vs 25M Base network limit)
- **Gas Efficiency**: Tests gas per NFT in airdrop vs regular minting

#### PRIORITY 2: Core Functionality ✅
- **Wallet Limits**: 5 NFT per wallet maximum (airdrops + purchases combined)
- **Automatic Airdrop**: Triggers when NFT #225 is minted
- **Rarity Tiers**: Fixed breakpoints (Genesis: 1-10, Pioneer: 11-100, Early Adopter: 101-225, Protocol User: 226-402)
- **Airdrop Recipients**: 27 recipients, 47 total NFTs

#### PRIORITY 3: Security Testing ✅
- **Access Controls**: Only serverWallet can mint, only owner can update settings
- **Input Validation**: Zero address checks, payment method validation
- **Edge Cases**: Max supply limits, duplicate airdrop prevention

### Utility Files
7. **`run-tests.sh`** - **NEW**: Test execution script
   - Runs all critical tests in order
   - Provides detailed output and gas reporting

## 🔥 Critical Tests

### 1. Airdrop Gas Consumption Test
```solidity
function testGas_AirdropGasConsumption() public {
    // Mints 224 NFTs, then 225th triggers airdrop
    // Measures total gas: 225th mint + 47 airdrop NFTs  
    // CRITICAL: Must be < 20M gas safety buffer
}
```

### 2. Wallet Limits Enforcement
```solidity
function test_AirdropRecipient5NFTsCannotPurchaseMore() public {
    // Tests that recipients with 5 airdropped NFTs 
    // cannot purchase additional NFTs
}
```

### 3. Automatic Airdrop Trigger
```solidity
function test_AutomaticAirdropTrigger() public {
    // Tests that airdrop executes automatically
    // when the 225th NFT is minted
}
```

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
cd /Users/Ryan/builds/x402-contract-deployer
chmod +x run-tests.sh
./run-tests.sh
```

### Individual Test Commands
```bash
# Critical airdrop gas test
forge test --match-test testGas_AirdropGasConsumption -vv

# All wallet limits tests
forge test --match-contract X402WalletLimitsTest -v

# Comprehensive gas report
forge test --gas-report

# All tests with verbose output
forge test -vv
```

## ⚠️ Critical Notes

### Gas Limits (MOST IMPORTANT)
- **Base Network Limit**: 25M gas per transaction
- **Safety Buffer**: Contract must use <20M gas (80% of limit)
- **Airdrop Gas**: ~6M estimated, must verify in tests
- **Failure Impact**: If gas exceeds limit, airdrop will fail and contract becomes unusable

### Hardcoded Addresses
- **27 Airdrop Recipients**: Cannot be changed after deployment
- **47 Total NFTs**: Distribution is fixed (1×5, 1×4, 3×3, 7×2, 15×1)
- **Verification**: All addresses have been included in tests

### Wallet Limits
- **5 NFT Maximum**: Includes both airdropped AND purchased NFTs
- **Enforcement**: Contract prevents exceeding limit via modifier
- **Edge Case**: Recipients with 5 airdropped NFTs cannot purchase more

### Server Wallet
- **Single Point of Failure**: Only serverWallet can mint
- **Recommendation**: Consider multi-sig wallet for production
- **Access**: Owner can update serverWallet address

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to mainnet:

- [ ] All Foundry tests pass (`forge test`)
- [ ] Gas consumption verified <20M for airdrop
- [ ] Deploy to Base Sepolia testnet first
- [ ] Test server wallet integration on testnet
- [ ] Verify metadata endpoints work
- [ ] Double-check all 27 airdrop addresses
- [ ] Test manual airdrop execution as backup
- [ ] Verify contract on Basescan after deployment

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Tests should verify:
- ✅ Airdrop gas usage < 20M (safety margin)
- ✅ All 27 recipients receive correct NFT amounts  
- ✅ Wallet limits enforced (max 5 NFTs including airdrops)
- ✅ Airdrop triggers automatically at NFT #225
- ✅ No duplicate airdrop execution possible
- ✅ Access controls working (only serverWallet mints)
- ✅ Emergency functions accessible by owner

## 📞 Support

If tests fail or gas usage exceeds safety limits:
1. Review gas optimization in `_executeFullAirdrop()` function
2. Consider reducing airdrop amounts if gas is too high
3. Test on Base Sepolia first to validate gas usage
4. Ensure all dependencies (OpenZeppelin, Chainlink) are correct versions
