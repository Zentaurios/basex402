# ✅ Header Display Fixed - Shows EOA Address

## Issue
The wallet header was displaying the **smart account address** (0x44F6...e9A9) instead of the **EOA address** (0x5E00...59d4).

## Fix Applied

**File:** `/src/components/wallet/WalletDropdown.tsx`  
**Line:** 284-287

### Before:
```typescript
// Use CDP address for embedded wallet, or walletAddress for external wallet
const displayAddress = evmAddress || walletAddress;
```

### After:
```typescript
// ✅ For embedded wallets, show EOA address (used for x402 signing)
// For external wallets, show the wallet address
const displayAddress = connectedWalletType === 'embedded' 
  ? (eoaAddress || evmAddress || walletAddress)  // Prefer EOA for embedded
  : (evmAddress || walletAddress);                // Use regular address for external
```

## What This Means

### For Embedded (CDP) Wallets:
- **Header button:** Shows EOA address (0x5E00...59d4) ✅
- **Dropdown detail:** Shows EOA address (0x5E00...59d4) ✅
- **x402 signing:** Uses EOA address ✅
- **NFT recipient:** Smart account (0x44F6...e9A9) - handled internally

### For External Wallets:
- **Header button:** Shows wallet address (already EOA) ✅
- **Dropdown detail:** Shows wallet address ✅
- **x402 signing:** Uses wallet address ✅
- **No change needed** - external wallets are already EOAs

## Testing

1. Connect with CDP embedded wallet
2. Check header - should show: `0x5E00...59d4` (EOA)
3. Click dropdown - should show: `0x5E00...59d4` (EOA)
4. Try minting - should work with EOA signing

## Architecture Reminder

```
CDP Smart Account Wallet:
├─ Smart Account: 0x44F6...e9A9 (receives NFTs, kept in background)
└─ EOA Owner: 0x5E00...59d4 (displayed, used for x402 signing)

External Wallet:
└─ EOA Wallet: 0xABCD...1234 (displayed, used for everything)
```

## Result

The header now correctly displays the EOA address that's actually being used for x402 signing, making it clear to users which address is signing their transactions.

**Status:** ✅ Fixed
