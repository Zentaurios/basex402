# 🚨 CDP Smart Account EIP-712 Signing Issue

## The Problem

**Error:** "EVM account not found" when trying to sign with smart account `0x44F6...`

### Root Cause
CDP Smart Accounts (ERC-4337) **cannot sign EIP-712 typed data** the same way EOAs can. The `signEvmTypedData` hook doesn't support smart accounts for this purpose.

### Why This Matters
- EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` requires an **EOA signature**
- Your CDP wallet has a **smart account** as the primary address (from `useEvmAddress()`)
- But signing needs to happen with the **owner EOA**, not the smart account

## 📋 Diagnosis Steps

### 1. Find the CDP User Inspection Logs

Look at the **very top** of your console (when the page first loads or when you connect) for:

```
🔍 === CDP USER & ADDRESS INSPECTION ===
🔍 Current User (full object): {...}
🔍 Current User: {
  hasUser: true,
  evmAccountsCount: X,
  evmSmartAccountsCount: X,
  firstEvmAccount: '0x...',  ← This is the EOA we need!
  firstSmartAccount: '0x...'  ← This is your primary address
}
```

**We need to see:**
- `firstEvmAccount` - The EOA that CAN sign EIP-712
- `firstSmartAccount` - The smart account (your primary address)

### 2. Share Those Logs

Please copy the entire `=== CDP USER & ADDRESS INSPECTION ===` section and share it.

## 🔧 Potential Solutions

### Solution A: Use EOA for Signing (If Available)

If `currentUser.evmAccounts[0]` exists, we can modify the code to:
1. Use the **EOA** for signing the payment authorization
2. But keep the **smart account** as the "from" address in the transfer

This would require updating both:
- The signer (use EOA)
- The message (keep smart account as "from")

### Solution B: Different Payment Method

Smart accounts might need a different approach:
1. **ERC-4337 UserOperations** instead of EIP-3009
2. **Paymaster** for gas sponsorship
3. Direct contract interaction instead of meta-transactions

### Solution C: Switch to External Wallet

External wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet) are EOAs and can sign EIP-712 messages directly.

## 🔍 Next Steps

**Please find and share the CDP User Inspection logs** so we can see:
1. If an EOA exists (`evmAccounts[0]`)
2. What format it's in
3. Whether we can use it for signing

Once we see those logs, I can implement the exact fix needed!

## Why Can't Smart Accounts Sign EIP-712?

From the CDP docs:
> "Smart accounts ([ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)) are smart contract wallets..."

Smart accounts are **contracts**, not regular accounts. They:
- ✅ Can send UserOperations (ERC-4337)
- ✅ Can batch transactions
- ✅ Can use paymasters
- ❌ **Cannot** sign EIP-712 messages like EOAs
- ❌ **Cannot** use EIP-3009 transferWithAuthorization

The underlying **owner EOA** can sign, but we need to:
1. Find it in `currentUser.evmAccounts[0]`
2. Use it specifically for signing (not as the primary address)

## Alternative: Check Your Wallet Configuration

In your CDP configuration, check:
```typescript
<CDPHooksProvider
  config={{
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    ethereum: {
      createOnLogin: "smart", // ← This creates smart accounts
    }
  }}
>
```

If you change `createOnLogin: "eoa"`, new users get regular EOAs that CAN sign EIP-712.

**But:** Your current user already has a smart account, so we need to work with what we have.

## 📝 Action Required

**Please scroll to the very top of the console and find/share:**
```
🔍 === CDP USER & ADDRESS INSPECTION ===
```

This will tell us exactly how to fix it! 🎯
