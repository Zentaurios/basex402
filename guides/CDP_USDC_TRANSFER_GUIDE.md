# üîß CDP Smart Account USDC Transfer Guide

## Problem

Your USDC is in your **Smart Account** (`0x44F6Db8E90B5B97fa08668Bdb2E968ad9A42e9A9`), but for EIP-3009 signatures to work, you need USDC in your **EOA** (Externally Owned Account: `0x5E0008Fa547064BF1feCeF0FbF091e8Df40B59d4`).

## Solution

Transfer USDC from your Smart Account to your EOA.

### Option 1: Use Coinbase Wallet App

1. Open Coinbase Wallet
2. Go to your USDC balance
3. Send USDC to your EOA address: `0x5E0008Fa547064BF1feCeF0FbF091e8Df40B59d4`
4. Amount: At least 1.00 USDC (or however many NFTs you want to mint)

### Option 2: Use CDP Transfer

We can create a transfer function in the app that moves USDC from your smart account to your EOA automatically before minting.

### Option 3: Different Signing Approach

Instead of using EIP-3009, we could:
1. Use a regular USDC transfer from the smart account
2. Or implement ERC-1271 signature verification (on-chain)

## Why This Is Needed

**EIP-3009 (`transferWithAuthorization`)**:
- Requires an off-chain ECDSA signature
- The signature must be from the account that holds the tokens
- Smart accounts can't create ECDSA signatures directly
- Only EOAs (like `0x5E00...9d4`) can create ECDSA signatures

**The Mismatch**:
- Smart Account (`0x44F6...9A9`) has the USDC ‚úÖ
- EOA (`0x5E00...9d4`) creates the signature ‚úÖ  
- But EIP-3009 expects them to be the same account ‚ùå

## What I Changed

Modified `useX402Signer.ts` to return the EOA address as `signer.address` instead of the smart account address. This makes the signature match the `from` field.

## Testing

1. **Check EOA USDC Balance**:
   - Go to: https://basescan.org/address/0x5E0008Fa547064BF1feCeF0FbF091e8Df40B59d4
   - Look for USDC balance

2. **If EOA has USDC**: Try minting again - it should work!

3. **If EOA has NO USDC**: Transfer from smart account first

## Alternative: Automatic Transfer Function

Would you like me to create a function that automatically transfers USDC from your smart account to your EOA before minting? This would make the flow seamless for users.

Let me know and I can implement that! üöÄ
