# üîß Critical Issue Found: Balance Fetching Wrong Address

## The Root Cause

You found it! The wallet dropdown is checking balances for the **smart account** instead of the **EOA**.

### Current Code (WRONG):
```typescript
// Line 162 in WalletDropdown.tsx
if (activeChain === 'ethereum' && evmAddress) {
  tokenBalances = await getTokenBalances(evmAddress);  // ‚ùå Smart Account!
}

// Line 74-76
const currentAddress = activeChain === 'ethereum' ? evmAddress : solanaAddress;  // ‚ùå Smart Account!
const { nfts, loading: loadingNFTs } = useNFTBalances(
  currentAddress,  // ‚ùå Checking smart account for NFTs
  activeTab === 'nfts'
);
```

### The Problem:

```
Your Funds:
‚îú‚îÄ Smart Account (0x44F6...e9A9): Empty ‚ùå
‚îî‚îÄ EOA Owner (0x5E00...59d4): Has USDC ‚úÖ

Balance Check:
‚îî‚îÄ Checking: Smart Account ‚ùå
   Result: Shows 0 balance even though you have USDC!
```

## Impact on Minting

This could explain the gas estimation error too! If any part of the minting flow checks the smart account balance:

1. **Balance check:** Smart account has 0 USDC ‚ùå
2. **Contract check:** Thinks user can't pay ‚ùå  
3. **Gas estimation:** Fails because transaction would revert ‚ùå

But x402 payment works because it uses the EOA with USDC ‚úÖ

## Two Issues Need Fixing

### Issue 1: Rate Limit Still Active ‚è±Ô∏è

**Why:** Rate limit data is stored in memory. My code changes need a server restart.

**Solution:** Restart your dev server:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

### Issue 2: Wrong Address for Balances üí∞

**The Fix Needed:**

```typescript
// WalletDropdown.tsx - Line 162
// OLD ‚ùå
if (activeChain === 'ethereum' && evmAddress) {
  tokenBalances = await getTokenBalances(evmAddress);
}

// NEW ‚úÖ
if (activeChain === 'ethereum') {
  // For embedded wallets, check EOA (where funds actually are)
  // For external wallets, use evmAddress (which is already an EOA)
  const addressToCheck = connectedWalletType === 'embedded' 
    ? (eoaAddress || evmAddress)
    : evmAddress;
  
  if (addressToCheck) {
    tokenBalances = await getTokenBalances(addressToCheck);
  }
}
```

And for NFTs:

```typescript
// Line 74
// OLD ‚ùå
const currentAddress = activeChain === 'ethereum' ? evmAddress : solanaAddress;

// NEW ‚úÖ
const currentAddress = activeChain === 'ethereum' 
  ? (connectedWalletType === 'embedded' ? (eoaAddress || evmAddress) : evmAddress)
  : solanaAddress;
```

## Testing Plan

### Step 1: Restart Server
```bash
# This will clear rate limit memory
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Don't Fix Balances Yet
Let's first test if minting works with rate limiting disabled. The balance display issue won't affect minting if we're already passing the EOA to the API (which we fixed earlier).

### Step 3: Check Logs
When you try to mint, look for:
- Server wallet ETH balance
- Payment sender address (should be EOA)
- NFT recipient address (should be EOA)
- These should all match!

## Why This Matters

### For Display:
- Shows 0 balance even though you have USDC
- NFTs don't appear even though you own them
- Confusing UX!

### For Minting (maybe):
If the server or contract checks the smart account balance instead of EOA:
- Sees 0 USDC
- Transaction would fail
- Gas estimation fails preemptively

## Next Steps

1. **Restart dev server** ‚Üí Clears rate limit
2. **Test minting** ‚Üí See if it works now
3. **If minting works** ‚Üí Fix balance display later  
4. **If minting fails** ‚Üí We know it's checking wrong address somewhere

**Critical Discovery:** You found the address mismatch! The app is checking the wrong wallet for balances.

Let me know if you want me to fix the balance fetching now, or if you want to restart the server and test minting first!
