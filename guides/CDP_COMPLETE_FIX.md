# CDP Embedded Wallet Signing - COMPLETE FIX ✅

## Progress Summary

### ✅ Fixed Issues
1. **BigInt Serialization** - Fixed by using strings for CDP wallets
2. **Missing evmAccount Parameter** - Fixed by calling without evmAccount
3. **Missing Address Parameter** - Fixed by passing address explicitly

## Final Solution

### Issue #3: Missing Address Parameter (LATEST)

**Error:**
```
400 (Bad Request)
property "address" is missing
```

**Root Cause:**
CDP's `signEvmTypedData` API requires an `address` parameter to know which account to use for signing.

**Fix Applied:**
In `/src/hooks/useX402Signer.ts`, pass the address explicitly:

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED - Add address parameter
const result = await (cdpSignTypedData as any)({
  address: currentUser.evmAccounts[0], // ✅ Specify which account to use
  typedData: {
    domain: args.domain as any,
    types: args.types as any,
    primaryType: args.primaryType as string,
    message: args.message as any,
  },
});
```

## Complete Fix Checklist

- ✅ **File 1:** `/src/hooks/useX402Signer.ts` - Added `address` parameter
- ✅ **File 2:** `/src/lib/x402-client.ts` - Use strings instead of BigInt for CDP wallets

## Testing Now

1. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test mint flow:**
   - Open incognito: `http://localhost:3000/mint`
   - Sign in with email
   - Click "Mint 1 NFT"

## Expected Console Logs (Success)

```
🔍 [useX402Signer] Using CDP embedded wallet
✍️ [useX402Signer] CDP signing typed data...
🔍 [useX402Signer] Calling CDP signEvmTypedData with address: 0x44F6...
✅ [useX402Signer] CDP signature successful: { signature: '0x123...' }
✅ [x402-client] Signature received from CDP wallet
✅ [x402-client] Payment header created successfully
✅ [x402-client] Payment accepted
🎉 Successfully minted 1 NFT!
```

## What Changed (Complete Summary)

### 1. useX402Signer.ts
```typescript
// Before: No parameters
const result = await cdpSignTypedData({ typedData: {...} });

// After: With address parameter
const result = await cdpSignTypedData({
  address: currentUser.evmAccounts[0], // ← Added
  typedData: {...}
});
```

### 2. x402-client.ts
```typescript
// Before: Always BigInt
const message = {
  value: BigInt(paymentPayload.value), // ❌ Breaks CDP
};

// After: Conditional based on wallet type
const message = isCdpWallet ? {
  value: paymentPayload.value, // ✅ String for CDP
} : {
  value: BigInt(paymentPayload.value), // ✅ BigInt for external wallets
};
```

## Why This Works

### CDP API Request Structure
```
POST https://api.cdp.coinbase.com/.../evm/sign/typed-data

Body: {
  "address": "0x44F6Db8E90B5B97fa08668Bdb2E968ad9A42e9A9",  // ← Required!
  "typedData": {
    "domain": {...},
    "types": {...},
    "message": {...}  // ← Must be JSON-serializable (strings, not BigInt)
  }
}
```

### Why Address is Required
- User may have multiple accounts
- CDP needs to know which private key to use
- The address specifies the signer

### Why Strings Not BigInt
- CDP SDK calls `JSON.stringify()` internally
- BigInt cannot be serialized to JSON
- Strings work because EIP-712 types handle conversion

## Architecture Flow

```
User clicks "Mint" 
    ↓
useX402Signer() returns signer
    ↓
signer.signTypedData() called
    ↓
wrappedCdpSignTypedData() executed
    ↓
Calls cdpSignTypedData({ 
  address: "0x44F6...", ✅ 
  typedData: { 
    message: { 
      value: "1000000" ✅  // String, not BigInt
    } 
  } 
})
    ↓
CDP API validates request ✅
    ↓
Signature returned ✅
    ↓
Payment processed ✅
    ↓
NFT minted ✅
```

## All Fixed Errors

1. ~~`TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt`~~ ✅ Fixed
2. ~~`request body has an error: doesn't match schema: property "evmAccount" is missing`~~ ✅ Fixed (we don't need evmAccount)
3. ~~`request body has an error: doesn't match schema: property "address" is missing`~~ ✅ Fixed (added address parameter)

## Status

🎯 **READY TO TEST** - All known issues fixed!

The embedded wallet signing should now work completely. Try minting an NFT and check the console for success logs!

## If It Still Fails

If you see any new errors:
1. Check the browser console for the exact error message
2. Look at the Network tab for the failed API request
3. Share the error logs

## Success Criteria

When it works, you'll see:
- ✅ No errors in console
- ✅ Signature created successfully
- ✅ Payment processed
- ✅ Transaction hash returned
- ✅ NFT shows up in your wallet
- ✅ Success screen displayed

Good luck! 🚀
