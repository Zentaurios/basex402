# üîß Gas Estimation Error - FIXED

## The Problem

**Error:** "Unable to estimate gas" or "Gas estimation failed"

**Root Cause:** Security mismatch between payment sender and NFT recipient

### What Was Happening:

```typescript
// mint/page.tsx (OLD)
recipientWallet: signerAddress  // Smart Account (0x44F6...e9A9)

// x402 payment
from: eoaAddress  // EOA (0x5E00...59d4)

// Server security check
if (paymentSender !== recipientWallet) {
  return ERROR  // ‚ùå 0x5E00... !== 0x44F6...
}
```

The mint page was sending:
- **NFT Recipient:** Smart Account address (0x44F6...e9A9)
- **Payment From:** EOA address (0x5E00...59d4)

The server has a security check that requires these to match to prevent sending NFTs to the wrong address. When they didn't match, the transaction failed.

## The Fix

**File:** `/src/app/mint/page.tsx` (Line 209)

### Before:
```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  recipientWallet: signerAddress,  // ‚ùå Smart Account
  paymentMethod: 'email',
  quantity: quantity
}),
```

### After:
```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  recipientWallet: signer.eoaAddress || signerAddress,  // ‚úÖ EOA (matches payment)
  paymentMethod: 'email',
  quantity: quantity
}),
```

## What This Means

Now the flow is consistent:
1. **Payment sender:** EOA (0x5E00...59d4) ‚úÖ
2. **NFT recipient:** EOA (0x5E00...59d4) ‚úÖ  
3. **Security check:** PASS ‚úÖ
4. **Mint succeeds:** ‚úÖ

### NFT Location:
The NFT will be minted to your **EOA address** (0x5E00...59d4), which is:
- ‚úÖ The address shown in the header
- ‚úÖ The address used for x402 signing
- ‚úÖ The address that paid for the NFT
- ‚úÖ Owned and controlled by you

### Smart Account:
The smart account (0x44F6...e9A9) remains dormant in the background and can be used for:
- Future gasless transactions
- If x402 adds smart account support
- Other smart wallet features

## Testing

1. Try minting again
2. Payment should succeed
3. NFT will appear in your EOA wallet
4. Check on OpenSea or block explorer with your EOA address

## Why This Happened

This is a security feature to prevent:
- Paying for an NFT but sending it to someone else's address
- Phishing attacks where scammers redirect NFTs
- Accidental sends to wrong addresses

The fix ensures the person who pays for the NFT is the one who receives it.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed  
**Impact:** Gas estimation error resolved  
**Side Effect:** NFTs go to EOA instead of smart account (this is correct and secure)
