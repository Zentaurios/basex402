# üéØ CDP Signing Fix - Address Mismatch Resolved

## The Root Cause (Discovered!)

Your logs revealed a **critical address mismatch**:

### Two Different Addresses:
1. **Smart Account** (from `useEvmAddress()`): `0x44F6Db8E90B5B97fa08668Bdb2E968ad9A42e9A9`
   - This is what appears in the typed data "from" field
   - This is your active account
   
2. **EOA** (from `currentUser.evmAccounts[0]`): `0x5E0008Fa547064BF1feCeF0FbF091e8Df40B59d4`
   - This is the owner EOA
   - This is what we were trying to sign with ‚ùå

### The Problem:
```
Message to sign: {from: '0x44F6...' (smart account), ...}
Signing with: '0x5E00...' (EOA)
```

**Result:** CDP error "Something went wrong" because we're asking the EOA to sign a message that says the smart account is authorizing the transfer.

## The Fix

Changed from using `currentUser.evmAccounts[0]` to using `cdpAddress` (from `useEvmAddress()`):

```typescript
// Before (WRONG) ‚ùå
const evmAccount = currentUser.evmAccounts[0]; // EOA address
const result = await cdpSignTypedData({
  evmAccount: evmAccount, // ‚ùå EOA
  typedData: { ... }
});

// After (CORRECT) ‚úÖ
const result = await cdpSignTypedData({
  evmAccount: cdpAddress, // ‚úÖ Smart account address (from useEvmAddress)
  typedData: { ... }
});
```

### Why This Works:
- `useEvmAddress()` returns the **primary address** (smart account if present, otherwise EOA)
- This matches the "from" field in the EIP-712 typed data
- CDP can now properly sign with the correct account

## Test It Now

```bash
# Clear cache
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache

# Restart
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. **Hard refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Try to mint** - it should work now! üéâ

## Expected Logs

You should see:
```
üîç Using cdpAddress for signing: {cdpAddress: '0x44F6...', type: 'string'}
üîç cdpAddress to use: {address: '0x44F6...', type: 'string'}
üîç typedData to sign: {messageFrom: '0x44F6...', ...}
‚úÖ CDP signature successful: 0x123...
```

Notice how the address matches the messageFrom now!

## Potential Smart Account Consideration

**Important Note:** You're using smart accounts (ERC-4337). If this still doesn't work, it might be because:

1. **EIP-3009 (transferWithAuthorization)** was designed for EOAs
2. **Smart accounts** might not support EIP-712 signatures the same way
3. You might need to use **ERC-4337 UserOperations** instead

### If It Still Fails:

We may need to:
1. Check if the smart account has USDC tokens (not the EOA)
2. Use a different signing method for smart accounts
3. Or use the EOA address for the transfer if the EOA holds the USDC

But let's try this fix first - it should work if CDP's smart accounts support EIP-712 signing! üöÄ
