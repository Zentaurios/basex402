# üîß CDP Signing Fix - Multi-Attempt Strategy

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

The CDP signing logic in `useX402Signer.ts` has been updated with a **comprehensive multi-attempt strategy** that tries 4 different API call patterns to handle CDP's signing interface.

### Problem
The CDP `useSignEvmTypedData` hook was consistently returning:
```
POST https://api.cdp.coinbase.com/.../evm/sign/typed-data
400 (Bad Request)
Error: property "address" is missing
```

### Root Cause
The CDP SDK's `signEvmTypedData` function API format was unclear, and we didn't know which parameter structure it expected.

---

## üéØ Solution: Progressive Fallback Strategy

The fix implements **4 progressive attempts** to find the correct API format:

### Attempt 1: Direct Typed Data (Most Common Pattern)
```typescript
await cdpSignTypedData({
  domain,
  types,
  primaryType,
  message
});
```
This is the most common pattern for signing hooks.

### Attempt 2: Address + TypedData Wrapper
```typescript
await cdpSignTypedData({
  address: cdpAddress,
  typedData: {
    domain,
    types,
    primaryType,
    message
  }
});
```
Nested structure with explicit address parameter.

### Attempt 3: Flat Structure with Address
```typescript
await cdpSignTypedData({
  address: cdpAddress,
  domain,
  types,
  primaryType,
  message
});
```
Flat structure including address at top level.

### Attempt 4: EOA Fallback
```typescript
await cdpSignTypedData({
  address: eoaAddress, // Use EOA instead of smart account
  typedData: {
    domain,
    types,
    primaryType,
    message
  }
});
```
If smart account signing fails, try with the underlying EOA address.

## üîç Enhanced Debugging

The fix includes comprehensive logging:

### Before Each Attempt
```
üîß [ATTEMPT N] Calling CDP with <strategy>...
```

### On Success
```
‚úÖ [ATTEMPT N] Success!
- attemptUsed: <which strategy worked>
- signaturePreview: 0x1234...5678
- signatureLength: 132
```

### On Failure
```
‚ùå [ATTEMPT N] Failed: <error message>
```

### Final Error (All Attempts Failed)
```
‚ùå All CDP signing attempts failed.

Errors encountered:
1. Direct call: <error>
2. Address wrapper: <error>
3. Flat structure: <error>
4. EOA fallback: <error>

üí° Possible solutions:
- Check CDP hooks documentation
- Verify smart account has USDC balance
- Try using external wallet instead
```

## üöÄ Testing Instructions

### 1. Test with CDP Embedded Wallet

```bash
# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000/mint
```

1. **Connect** using email (creates CDP embedded wallet)
2. **Click Mint** button
3. **Watch console** for:
   ```
   üîß [ATTEMPT 1] Calling CDP...
   ‚úÖ [ATTEMPT 1] Success!  <-- Should succeed on attempt 1, 2, 3, or 4
   ```
4. **Sign** the transaction when prompted
5. **Verify** NFT mints successfully

### 2. Test with External Wallet

1. **Connect** using MetaMask/Rainbow/Coinbase Wallet
2. **Click Mint** button
3. Should work normally (external wallet path unchanged)

### 3. Monitor Console Output

Look for these key logs:

#### Hook Initialization
```
üîç [useX402Signer] Using CDP smart account wallet
- smartAccountAddress: 0x44F6...
- eoaAddress: 0x1234...
- hasSignTypedData: true
```

#### Signing Process
```
‚úçÔ∏è [useX402Signer] Starting CDP signing with multiple attempts...
üîç [DEBUG] CDP Hook Details: { hookType: 'function', isFunction: true }
```

#### Success Indicator
```
‚úÖ [useX402Signer] CDP signature successful:
- attemptUsed: <which attempt worked>
- signaturePreview: 0x...
```

## üìä Expected Outcomes

### Best Case Scenario
- **Attempt 1 succeeds** ‚Üí CDP SDK uses direct typed data format
- Fast signing, minimal retries
- Logs: `‚úÖ [ATTEMPT 1] Success!`

### Good Scenario
- **Attempt 2 or 3 succeeds** ‚Üí CDP SDK uses wrapped format
- Still fast, found correct format
- Logs: `‚úÖ [ATTEMPT 2] Success!` or `‚úÖ [ATTEMPT 3] Success!`

### Fallback Scenario
- **Attempt 4 succeeds** ‚Üí Smart account signing not supported, using EOA
- Works but using EOA (which has USDC)
- Logs: `‚ö†Ô∏è [ATTEMPT 4] Success with EOA!`
- **Note**: This is suboptimal but functional

### Failure Scenario
- **All 4 attempts fail** ‚Üí CDP SDK configuration issue
- Detailed error message with all 4 errors
- Logs: `‚ùå All CDP signing attempts failed`
- **Action**: Check error messages for specific CDP API issues

---

## üîß What to Check If It Still Fails

### 1. CDP SDK Configuration
```bash
# Check CDP packages version
npm list @coinbase/cdp-hooks
npm list @coinbase/cdp-sdk

# Should see version ^0.0.43
```

### 2. Network Inspection
Open **DevTools** ‚Üí **Network** tab ‚Üí Filter for "cdp.coinbase.com"
- Look at the actual API request payload
- Compare with expected format

### 3. Smart Account Balance
```typescript
// Check if smart account has USDC
const usdcBalance = await usdcContract.balanceOf(cdpAddress);
console.log('Smart account USDC:', usdcBalance);
```

### 4. Authentication
```typescript
// Verify CDP authentication
const { currentUser } = useCurrentUser();
console.log('CDP user:', currentUser);
console.log('Smart accounts:', currentUser?.evmSmartAccounts);
console.log('EOA accounts:', currentUser?.evmAccounts);
```

---

## üí° Alternative Approaches (If All Else Fails)

### Option A: Use EOA Directly
Modify payment flow to use EOA instead of smart account:
```typescript
// In useX402Signer.ts
const signingAddress = currentUser?.evmAccounts?.[0] || cdpAddress;
```

### Option B: Switch to External Wallet
Guide users to connect with MetaMask/Rainbow instead of CDP embedded wallet.

### Option C: Direct API Call
If the hook continues failing, make direct HTTP requests to CDP API:
```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://api.cdp.coinbase.com/.../sign', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ /* format TBD */ })
});
```

### Option D: Contact Coinbase Support
If CDP SDK is genuinely broken or undocumented, reach out to:
- Coinbase Developer Discord
- CDP GitHub issues
- Coinbase support team

- Added comprehensive debug logging
- Enhanced error messages with actionable solutions
- Improved signature validation
