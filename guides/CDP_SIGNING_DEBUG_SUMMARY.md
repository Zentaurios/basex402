# 🎯 CDP Signing Debug Summary

## What We Did

Added comprehensive debugging to `/src/hooks/useX402Signer.ts` to diagnose the "EVM account not found" error when signing with CDP embedded wallet.

## What Your Logs Show

✅ **Good:**
- CDP address is a string: `'0x44F6Db8E90B5B97fa08668Bdb2E968ad9A42e9A9'`
- CDP sign function exists and is properly defined
- Wallet is connected and recognized

❌ **Problem:**
- The detailed debug logs from the signing attempt are missing (lines 112-582 truncated)
- The "🔍 === PRE-SIGN DEBUG START ===" logs aren't showing
- This means your code is cached!

## Action Required: Clear Cache & Get Full Logs

### Quick Steps:

```bash
cd /Users/Ryan/builds/x402-contract-deployer

# Clear cache
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

**Then in browser:**
- Do a hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux)
- Keep DevTools console open from the start
- Try to mint 1 NFT
- Copy the COMPLETE console output (don't let it truncate)

### What We Need to See:

1. **🔍 === PRE-SIGN DEBUG START ===** - Shows what's being passed to CDP
2. **🔍 === ERROR DEBUG START ===** - Shows detailed error info

These logs will tell us exactly what CDP expects!

## Likely Solutions (Once We See Full Logs)

Based on the error "EVM account not found", these are the most likely fixes:

### Theory 1: CDP Needs Initialization Delay
```typescript
// Add a small delay before signing
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
```

### Theory 2: CDP Expects Account Object, Not String
```typescript
// Get the account object from CDP directly
const user = await getCurrentUser();
const evmAccount = user.evmAccounts[0];
```

### Theory 3: CDP Isn't Fully Authenticated
```typescript
// Check authentication state before signing
if (!isCdpSignedIn || !cdpAddress) {
  throw new Error('CDP not authenticated');
}
```

## Current Status

🔍 **Waiting for:** Full debug output after clearing cache  
🎯 **Goal:** See what CDP actually expects for the `evmAccount` parameter  
⚡ **Next:** Once we see the full logs, we'll implement the exact fix needed

---

## TL;DR

Your code changes are cached. Clear `.next` and `node_modules/.cache`, restart the dev server, do a hard browser refresh, then try minting again. Share the FULL console output (especially the PRE-SIGN and ERROR debug sections) and we'll know exactly what to fix! 🚀
