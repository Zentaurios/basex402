# üîç Getting Full Debug Output

## The Problem

Your browser/Next.js has cached the old code. The new debug logs we added to `wrappedCdpSignTypedData` aren't showing up because:
- Lines 112-582 are truncated in your console
- The "üîç === PRE-SIGN DEBUG START ===" logs are missing
- The "üîç === ERROR DEBUG START ===" logs are missing

## Solution: Clear Cache & Get Full Logs

### Step 1: Clear Next.js Cache
```bash
cd /Users/Ryan/builds/x402-contract-deployer

# Method A: Use the script
chmod +x clear-cache.sh
./clear-cache.sh

# Method B: Manual commands
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache
**In Chrome/Brave:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

**OR press:**
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

### Step 4: Try to Mint Again

1. Connect with CDP embedded wallet
2. Try to mint 1 NFT
3. **Keep the console open from the start**
4. **Copy ALL console output** (not truncated)

### Step 5: Share These Specific Sections

Look for and share:

1. **üîç === CDP ADDRESS DEEP INSPECTION ===**
   - Shows if address is string or object

2. **üîç === PRE-SIGN DEBUG START ===** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è THIS IS THE KEY ONE!
   - Shows exactly what's being passed to CDP signing

3. **üîç === ERROR DEBUG START ===** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è THIS TOO!
   - Shows detailed error information

## Alternative: Check if CDP is Fully Initialized

The error "EVM account not found" might mean CDP isn't fully initialized when we try to sign. Let me know if you still get the error after clearing cache, and we'll add an initialization check.

## What We're Looking For

The full error object should tell us:
- What CDP expects for `evmAccount`
- If it needs an account object instead of a string
- If there's an initialization issue
- Any other hints about the proper format

Once we see the **complete** debug output (especially the PRE-SIGN and ERROR sections), we'll know exactly what to fix! üéØ
