# ⚠️ Rate Limiting Disabled for Testing

## What Was Done

Temporarily commented out all rate limiting checks in `/src/app/api/mint/route.ts` to allow testing without delays.

### Changes Made:

1. **Lines 146-187:** Commented out IP and wallet rate limit checks
2. **Line 515:** Commented out successful mint tracking (fallback path)
3. **Line 537:** Commented out successful mint tracking (main path)
4. **Line 190:** Added fake rate limit object for response headers

### Code:
```typescript
// ⚠️ RATE LIMITING TEMPORARILY DISABLED FOR TESTING
// TODO: Re-enable before production deployment

/* COMMENTED OUT FOR TESTING
[all rate limit checks]
*/

// Create fake rate limit check for response headers
const rateLimitCheck = { allowed: true, remainingRequests: 999, resetTime: Date.now() + 3600000 };
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Before Production

**YOU MUST RE-ENABLE RATE LIMITING BEFORE DEPLOYING TO PRODUCTION!**

To re-enable:
1. Remove the `/* ... */` comment block
2. Delete the fake `rateLimitCheck` object
3. Uncomment all `trackSuccessfulMint()` calls

## Testing Notes

### ETH Balance Issue

You mentioned: "EOA had no ETH because it was USDC from gasless wallet"

This is expected! When CDP creates a smart account:
- **Smart Account:** Gets USDC for x402 payments (gasless)
- **EOA Owner:** Has NO ETH initially ❌

**Problem:** The EOA needs ETH for gas fees to mint!

### Solutions:

#### Option 1: Fund the EOA with ETH (Recommended for Testing)
```
1. Copy your EOA address from the header (0x5E00...59d4)
2. Send some test ETH to it:
   - Base Sepolia: Get from faucet
   - Base Mainnet: Send real ETH
3. Try minting again
```

#### Option 2: Use Server-Side Gas Sponsorship (Already Implemented!)
The contract uses the server wallet to pay gas fees, not the user's EOA. However:
- Server wallet needs ETH (already checked in code)
- User just needs to sign the x402 payment (no gas needed for signing)

### Current Architecture:

```
User's EOA (0x5E00...59d4):
├─ USDC: ✅ (from x402 payment)
├─ ETH: ❌ (needs for minting transaction)
└─ Signs: ✅ (can sign x402 payment without gas)

Server Wallet:
├─ ETH: ✅ (pays for minting gas)
└─ Executes: ✅ (mints NFT on behalf of user)
```

## Test Again

With rate limiting disabled, you can now test repeatedly. If you still get gas errors:

1. **Check server wallet balance:**
   - Server logs should show: "Server wallet balance: X.XXX ETH"
   - If < 0.001 ETH, server needs funding

2. **Check EOA has USDC:**
   - User needs 1 USDC per NFT to mint
   - USDC should be in EOA address (0x5E00...)

3. **Verify address matches:**
   - Payment from: EOA (0x5E00...)
   - NFT recipient: EOA (0x5E00...)
   - Both should match!

## Rate Limit Settings (For When You Re-Enable)

Current limits (from mint-rate-limiter.ts):
- **IP Limit:** 10 requests per hour
- **Wallet Limit:** 5 requests per hour
- **Successful Mints:** 5 per wallet (permanent)

These limits are separate from the contract limit (also 5 NFTs per wallet).

**Status:** Rate limiting DISABLED for testing  
**Remember:** RE-ENABLE before production!
